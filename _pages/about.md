Hi! Iâ€™m Sandeep, a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), and a Graduate Research Assistant with the [Steinschneider Research Group](https://blogs.cornell.edu/steinschneider/).

Originally from Nepal, I came to the United States for graduate studies. I am interested in using AI, statistics, and computational modeling to better understand environmental and water resources systems, enhance their resilience in a changing climate, and contribute to a sustainable future.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, reading, watching a good movie or series, and playing a game of chess.

Education
======
*PhD, Civil and Environmental Engineering*, 2024-Present <br>
    Cornell University, Ithaca, NY <br>

*MS, Water Resources*, 2024 <br>
    University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT <br>

*BS, Civil Engineering*, 2019 <br>
    Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk, Nepal <br>


Experience
======
I have diverse experience as a data specialist, civil (hydrologic/hydraulic) engineer, and researcher. My journey began as a data specialist during my undergraduate studies, where I first realized the power of data-driven insights. After graduating, I worked as a civil (hydrologic/hydraulic) engineer, gaining hands-on experience with hydropower and irrigation projects while exploring the stunning landscapes of Nepal.

From there, I joined the University of Connecticut as a graduate research assistant and am now continuing my research journey at Cornell University as a PhD student. I enjoy using my data-centric engineering skills to make processes more efficient, often turning to programming for creative problem-solving. <br>
