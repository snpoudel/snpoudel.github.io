Hi! I’m Sandeep, a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and a Graduate Research Assistant with the [Steinschneider Research Group](https://blogs.cornell.edu/steinschneider/).

I grew up in Nepal and came to the United States for graduate school. My work sits at the intersection of AI, statistics, and hydrology. I study water, environmental, and climate systems and aim to help improve their resilience in a changing climate.

When I’m not working with data and models, I’m usually somewhere out in nature, reading a sci-fi novel, watching a good show, or playing a few games of chess.

Experience
======
<hr style="border: 1px solid grey; margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: 2;">

I have a diverse background spanning data science, hydrologic and hydraulic engineering, and academic research. My journey began as a data specialist during my undergraduate studies, where I first discovered the impact of data-driven insights. After earning my degree, I worked as a civil engineer, gaining hands-on experience with hydropower and irrigation projects while exploring the stunning landscapes of Nepal.

I then moved into research, first at the University of Connecticut as a Masters student and now at Cornell University as a PhD student. I enjoy using data-centric engineering approaches to explore and better understand water, environmental, and climate systems. I also often find myself diving into programming to experiment with new models and methodologies. <br>
