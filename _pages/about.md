Hi, I am Sandeep. I am a PhD student in [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), and a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Steinschneider Research Group](https://blogs.cornell.edu/steinschneider/).

I grew up in Nepal and came to the US for graduate studies.
I have a strong interest in water, environment, and climate change and enjoy utilizing computational techniques to work around the challenges in this regime. I did an undergraduate in civil engineering which sparked my initial interest in this area, and I took on various coursework and projects to develop my skills. Following my undergraduate, I worked in an engineering firm for a few years before deciding to pursue graduate studies.

I enjoy using AI tools and statistics to study hydrological system and impacts of climate change. I plan to dedicate my career in the nexus of hydrolgy, climate change, and AI.

Outside of work, I like reading, hiking, watching movies/series, and playing chess.
