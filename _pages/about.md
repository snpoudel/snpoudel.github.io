Hi! Iâ€™m Sandeep, a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), and a Graduate Research Assistant with the [Steinschneider Research Group](https://blogs.cornell.edu/steinschneider/).

Originally from Nepal, I came to the United States for graduate studies. I am interested in using AI, statistics, and computational modeling to better understand environmental and water resources systems, enhance their resilience in a changing climate, and contribute to a sustainable future.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, reading, watching a good movie or series, and playing a game of chess.
