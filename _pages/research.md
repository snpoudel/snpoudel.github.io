**Estimating change of design floods using process-based, deep learning, and hybrid hydrological models**

Designing water infrastrustructures into the future requires understanding how the design flood magnitude will change under future climate conditions. We use hydrological models to estimate how design flood would change, but hydrological models are full of uncertainties. This study explores the uncertainty in projecting the change in design flood using different hydrological model types, and under different level of input precipitation uncertainty. Our result suggest that there is large uncertainties in these change projections and Deep learning models provided most competitive results. <br>

**Future of United States coastal housing market and the National Flood Insurance Program in a changing climate**

Flooding caused by rising sea levels, intensified storm surges, and extreme rainfall has huge impacts on human-water systems, posing an increasing threat to the national economy and financial stability in the United States. We use socio-environmental models and climate emission scenarios and projected a substantial rise in flood damage, which could put the National Flood Insurance Program in a more tenuous position, and potentially raise the risk of a future housing market crash. Additionally, the flood risk is disproportionately distributed, with the most socially vulnerable populations facing the greatest danger.<br>

**Role of flood insurance, risk perception, and memory of flood in the dynamics of coastal housing market**

How flooding affects home values can determine the path of economic recovery for communities and have lasting impacts on national and global financial systems. Our Study (for 1970 to 2021) in the coastal census tracts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, US found that initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy (2012, 3.5m MSL) was largely absorbed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); however, the region then exhibited a long-term decline in home values. Participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, communities' perception of risk, and the memory of past flooding events were important regional drivers of housing prices. <br>
