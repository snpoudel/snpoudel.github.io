**Future of United States coastal housing market and the National Flood Insurance Program in a changing climate**

Flooding caused by rising sea levels, intensified storm surges, and extreme rainfall has huge impacts on human-water systems, posing an increasing threat to the national economy and financial stability in the United States. We use socio-environmental models and climate emission scenarios and projected a substantial rise in flood damage, which could put the National Flood Insurance Program in a more tenuous position, and potentially raise the risk of a future housing market crash. Additionally, the flood risk is disproportionately distributed, with the most socially vulnerable populations facing the greatest danger.<br>

**Role of flood insurance, risk perception, and memory of flood in the dynamics of coastal housing market**

How flooding affects home values can determine the path of economic recovery for communities and have lasting impacts on national and global financial systems. Our Study (for 1970 to 2021) in the coastal census tracts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, US found that initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy (2012, 3.5m MSL) was largely absorbed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); however, the region then exhibited a long-term decline in home values. Participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, communities' perception of risk, and the memory of past flooding events were important regional drivers of housing prices. <br>
